### Progress
- [ ] Make changes to implement cout for klee
- [ ] Figuring out the stage at which cout makes the call to C functions (and which C function)
- [ ] Figuring out the call heirarchy for cout
- [x] Figuring out changes between uclibc and klee-uclibc for puts()

### Note
- Due to a **Family Emergency**, I was able to work very less this week.
