1. **Linux and KLEE Installation**:     Around 4.5 hours
2. **Research Papers (King & KLEE)**:   Around 6 hours



**Note**: 
1. These times are rough estimates.
2. Linux and KLEE Installation took quite some time as I tried KLEE installation three times (on fresh copies of Ubuntu 16). This also involves searching for solutions to the issues that I faced.  Finally, It worked fine on Ubuntu 14 (Following Eirine's instructions).
